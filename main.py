        *Q1:* What is the Plant Disease Recognition System?  
        *A1:* It is an AI-based system that uses machine learning to recognize plant diseases from images of plant leaves. Simply upload an image, and the system will provide predictions along with relevant solutions.

        *Q2:* How does the system work?  
        *A2:* The system uses a trained deep learning model that processes the image you upload and compares it with the dataset it was trained on to identify the disease. It then outputs the disease name and a suggested treatment or action.

        *Q3:* What types of diseases can the system detect?  
        *A3:* The system can detect over 20 types of diseases affecting crops like tomatoes, apples, peppers, and more. The model is trained on a large dataset of plant diseases from various agricultural sectors.

    st.subheader("Image Upload and Prediction")
    st.markdown("""
        *Q4:* What types of images can I upload?  
        *A4:* You can upload JPG, JPEG, or PNG files. We recommend that the images be clear and focused on the plant leaf, with minimal obstructions such as dirt, water droplets, or other distractions.

        *Q5:* How do I upload an image?  
        *A5:* On the *Disease Recognition* page, youâ€™ll find an option to upload an image of your plant leaf. After uploading, click on the *Predict Disease* button to get the results.

        *Q6:* Why is my uploaded image not being processed?  
        *A6:* Ensure that the image format is supported (JPG, JPEG, PNG) and that the image is not too large. If the issue persists, try uploading a higher-quality image with clear visibility of the leaf.

    """)

    st.subheader("Results and Predictions")
    st.markdown("""
        *Q7:* How accurate is the prediction?  
        *A7:* The model has an accuracy of up to 95%, depending on the image quality and the disease being detected. We continually update and improve the model to enhance its performance.

        *Q8:* Can the system predict multiple diseases in one image?  
        *A8:* Currently, the system is designed to predict a single disease from the uploaded image. However, future updates may include support for detecting multiple diseases simultaneously.

        *Q9:* What should I do if the prediction is incorrect?  
        *A9:* While the system is highly accurate, no AI model is perfect. If the prediction is incorrect, ensure that the image is clear and focused. If the issue persists, you can manually check other potential diseases using the *Disease Info* section.

        *Q10:* Does the system provide treatment for detected diseases?  
        *A10:* Yes, for each predicted disease, the system provides recommended treatment or action based on common practices and research. These recommendations are based on available literature and may vary depending on the severity of the disease.

        *Q11:* How do I interpret the recommended solutions?  
        *A11:* The recommended solutions typically include methods such as using pesticides, fungicides, or changing environmental conditions to prevent the spread of the disease. Always consult an agricultural expert or specialist for confirmation before taking any actions.

        *Q12:* What is the dataset used to train the model?  
        *A12:* The model was trained using a dataset of over 87,000 images of plant leaves, categorized into 38 disease classes. This dataset was created by collecting various images from reliable agricultural sources and is used to teach the model to recognize different diseases.

        *Q13:* How was the model trained?  
        *A13:* The model was trained using deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are effective for image recognition tasks. The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust performance.

        *Q14:* Can I use this model on my own dataset?  
        *A14:* Yes, the model can be fine-tuned and retrained on your dataset if you have your own images. You would need to gather and label your images, then retrain the model using techniques such as transfer learning to adapt it to your dataset.
